# ü§ñ WellnessAI Agent System

## Overview

WellnessAI features a sophisticated **agentic AI system** that goes far beyond traditional chatbots or reactive AI assistants. This system implements six core capabilities that work together to create a truly intelligent fitness companion.

## üß† Core Agentic Capabilities

### 1. **Memory & Context** (`agentMemory.ts`)

**Purpose**: Persistent memory system that remembers everything about the user across sessions.

**Key Features**:
- **Conversation History**: Every interaction is stored with context
- **User Preferences**: Learning and evolving preference tracking
- **Progress Patterns**: Long-term analysis of user behavior and outcomes
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies what works best for each individual user

**Example**: The AI remembers that you mentioned "dips work exceptionally well for my triceps" and will prioritize dips in future tricep recommendations.

```typescript
// Stores comprehensive user insights
interface ConversationEntry {
  timestamp: string;
  userMessage: string;
  aiResponse: string;
  context: {
    screenContext?: string;
    dataContext?: any;
    actionTaken?: string;
  };
}
```

### 2. **Goal-Oriented Behavior** (`goalOriented.ts`)

**Purpose**: Actively works toward user's specific fitness goals with proactive suggestions.

**Key Features**:
- **Proactive Suggestions**: AI suggests actions before you ask
- **Adaptive Planning**: Plans evolve based on progress and circumstances
- **Milestone Tracking**: Celebrates achievements and adjusts targets
- **Goal Decomposition**: Breaks complex goals into actionable steps

**Example**: If you haven't worked out in 7 days, the AI proactively suggests a quick 15-minute session to restart momentum.

```typescript
interface ProactiveSuggestion {
  type: 'workout_reminder' | 'rest_day' | 'nutrition_adjustment' | 'goal_check';
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  message: string;
  actionButtons?: Array<{ text: string; action: string; }>;
  triggerCondition: string;
}
```

### 3. **Tool Usage** (`toolUsage.ts`)

**Purpose**: Seamlessly integrates external data sources for intelligent decision-making.

**Key Features**:
- **Weather Integration**: Suggests indoor alternatives when weather is poor
- **Nutrition APIs**: Enhanced food database and macro calculations
- **Calendar Sync**: Workout scheduling around your commitments
- **Platform Adaptation**: Different capabilities for web vs mobile

**Example**: "Weather isn't great for outdoor running today. How about trying a HIIT circuit instead?"

```typescript
class ToolUsageService {
  async getWeatherForWorkout(): Promise<WeatherData>
  async generateWorkoutAlternatives(originalExercise: string, reason: string): Promise<string[]>
  async getNutritionData(foodItem: string): Promise<NutritionInfo>
}
```

### 4. **Learning & Adaptation** (`learningAdaptation.ts`)

**Purpose**: Continuously learns from user responses and outcomes to improve recommendations.

**Key Features**:
- **Outcome Tracking**: Monitors success/failure of recommendations
- **Feedback Loops**: Learns from user satisfaction ratings
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies what works best for each user
- **Model Adaptation**: Adjusts behavior based on user preferences

**Example**: If you consistently rate high-intensity workouts poorly, the AI learns to suggest moderate-intensity alternatives.

```typescript
interface OutcomeTracking {
  recommendationId: string;
  userResponse: 'followed' | 'modified' | 'ignored';
  outcome: 'positive' | 'neutral' | 'negative';
  feedback?: {
    satisfaction: number; // 1-5
    effectiveness: number; // 1-5
    notes?: string;
  };
}
```

### 5. **Autonomous Actions** (`autonomousActions.ts`)

**Purpose**: Automatically optimizes routines and triggers interventions without user prompting.

**Key Features**:
- **Plateau Detection**: Automatically identifies performance plateaus
- **Routine Optimization**: Adjusts workouts based on performance data
- **Intervention Triggers**: Suggests changes when patterns indicate issues
- **Automated Adjustments**: Makes small improvements continuously

**Example**: Detects you've been stuck at the same bench press weight for 3 weeks and automatically suggests a deload week.

```typescript
interface AutonomousAction {
  id: string;
  type: 'routine_optimization' | 'plateau_intervention' | 'recovery_suggestion';
  description: string;
  confidence: number;
  status: 'executed' | 'user_approval_required' | 'cancelled';
}
```

### 6. **Planning & Reasoning** (`planningReasoning.ts`)

**Purpose**: Multi-step goal planning with sophisticated reasoning about cause and effect.

**Key Features**:
- **Strategic Planning**: Long-term goal achievement strategies
- **Contingency Planning**: Backup plans for different scenarios
- **Causal Reasoning**: Understands relationships between actions and outcomes
- **Complex Problem Solving**: Handles multi-faceted fitness challenges

**Example**: Plans a 12-week body recomposition program with contingencies for travel, schedule changes, and plateau scenarios.

```typescript
interface GoalPlan {
  mainObjective: string;
  timeline: string;
  phases: Array<{
    name: string;
    duration: string;
    objectives: string[];
    strategies: string[];
  }>;
  contingencies: Array<{
    scenario: string;
    adjustment: string;
  }>;
}
```

## üéØ Orchestration (`agentOrchestrator.ts`)

The **Agent Orchestrator** coordinates all capabilities into a cohesive experience:

### Core Functions:
- **Context Management**: Maintains conversation context across interactions
- **Response Generation**: Creates intelligent, contextual responses
- **Capability Coordination**: Decides which AI capabilities to engage for each situation
- **Emergency Handling**: Manages crisis scenarios (injuries, motivation issues, equipment failures)

### Contextual Intelligence:
- **Screen Awareness**: Knows which screen you're on and adapts responses
- **Session Continuity**: Remembers previous conversations and builds on them
- **Goal Integration**: All responses consider your personal fitness goals
- **Learning Integration**: Applies learned preferences to every interaction

## üß© Comprehensive User Profiling

### Brain Dump System (`comprehensiveProfile.ts`)

The comprehensive profiling system captures detailed personal insights that enable unprecedented personalization:

**Exercise Insights**:
- Exercise responses: "Dips make my triceps grow more than other exercises"
- Workout preferences: "I respond better to higher volume on legs"
- Injury history with current status and exercise modifications

**Nutrition Insights**:
- Food sensitivities: "Dairy makes me bloated"
- What works: "Eating carbs at night helps me sleep better"
- Diet history and effectiveness patterns

**Personal Insights**:
- Growth patterns: "I lose weight in my face first"
- Unique circumstances: "I work night shifts"
- Personal theories: "I think stress affects my weight more than diet"

**Lifestyle Context**:
- Work schedule, family commitments, travel frequency
- Sleep patterns, stress factors, motivation triggers
- Mental aspects of fitness and food relationships

## üîÑ Integration & Workflow

### How It All Works Together:

1. **User Interaction**: User asks a question or performs an action
2. **Context Loading**: Agent loads conversation history and user profile
3. **Capability Selection**: Orchestrator determines which AI capabilities to engage
4. **Response Generation**: Creates personalized response using all available context
5. **Action Execution**: Takes any autonomous actions or provides suggestions
6. **Memory Update**: Stores interaction and learns from user response
7. **Continuous Optimization**: Adjusts future behavior based on outcomes

### Real-World Example:

**User**: "How can I improve my bench press?"

**AI Agent Process**:
1. **Memory**: Recalls user mentioned plateau issues and that dips work well for triceps
2. **Goal-Oriented**: Considers user's lean muscle goal and current program
3. **Learning**: References past successful recommendations for this user
4. **Planning**: Creates multi-week progression plan
5. **Tool Usage**: Checks if user has necessary equipment
6. **Response**: Provides personalized advice considering injury history and preferences

**AI Response**: 
"Based on your profile, I see you've mentioned plateau challenges before. Since you respond well to dips for tricep development, let's focus on technique refinement and accessory work. Given your shoulder history, we'll emphasize proper warm-up and controlled movements..."
